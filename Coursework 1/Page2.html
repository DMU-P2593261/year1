  <div class="castParagraphs"
    <p> James Donovan Halliday is the creator of the OASIS and instigator of the Easter egg hunt. His OASIS avatar is a wizard called Anorak. He was born in 1972 and grew up in Middletown, Ohio. His father was an alcoholic and his mother suffered from bipolar disorder, and the two of them often fought. To make matters worse, Halliday was an extremely shy and awkward child. He is thought to have been on the autism spectrum, and was extremely intelligent, with certain “obsessions” such as computers, videogames, and 1980s pop culture.
    <br>
    <br> Halliday retreated into his obsessions in order to avoid the misery of his life. In high school, he designs his first videogame, and after graduating he founds a company with his best friend Ogen Morrow, titled Gregarious Games. In 2012, he and Morrow release the OASIS.
    <br>
    <br> Although Halliday dies a multi-billionaire who is one of the most idolized people on the planet, it becomes clear that he had regrets about the way he lived his life. Chief among these is the fact that he never confessed his feelings to Kira Underwood, a childhood friend who became Morrow’s wife and who was the only person Halliday ever loved. </p>
