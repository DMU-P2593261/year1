<!-- WEBSITE TAB INFORMATION -->
<!--
This part of the code is for the website head. This changes the tab information such as the favicon and the text displayed next to it.
 -->
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport"content="width=device-width"/>
  <title>Ready Player One - Home</title>
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="img\icon-1.ico">
  <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

  <body>


<!--
To create the header I placed the title of the film and a menu with two anchored links to help users navigate back and forth between pages.
I also wrapped the menu within a nav element to help screen readers process the website correctly.
The header itself was placed within a "title" class which for me made it easier to add the CSS rules to this section later on.

  <!-- WEBSITE HEADER -->
    <header class="title">
      <h1>Ready Player One</h1>
      <div class="menu">
        <nav>
        <a href="page1.html">Home</a>
        <a href="page2.html">Cast and Crew</a>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </header>


<!--
Within this section I have the class "page1" which is where everything is stored so I can easily apply style rules later on.
I used one paragraph element to display the film synopsis and a video element to place the required trailer directly udnerneath.
I used two different file formats to maximise the playability of the content. I also added a fallback underneath just in case the video is not supported.
These are also all within their own classes to make styling withiin the CSS page easier.

  <!-- FILM SYNOPSIS -->
  <div class="page1">
    <div class="synopsis">
      <p> It's the year 2045 and the world is at a point of utter chaos, but the population find their escape in the OASIS: a virtual reality universe built by the eccentric creator James Haliday.
      <br>
      <br> When Haliday passes away, he vouches to give his immense fortune to the first individual to discover an easter egg that's hidden deep within the OASIS's many realms.
      <br>
      <br> When Wade Watts enters the competition, he discovers himself becoming the hero in a reality-bending treasure hunt through a land of friendship, mystery and danger.

<!--
To create the footer I again wrapped everything within a class named "title" which is the same as the header.
Within the footer I added some generic copyright detailing and my student number.
I also included two links to external websites using the anchor element. Once again these are wrapped within a nav element to make it easier for screen readers.
