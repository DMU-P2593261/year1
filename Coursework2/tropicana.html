      <p> The airport is one of the fundemental building blocks of every island. The airport is where players will first start when opening up the game for the first time.
          Once the tutorial for the game has ended the airport opens up fully and allows players to travel back and forth to islands owned by other players.
          That is assuming they have a Nintendo Online subscription.</p>

<!-- DAILY ROUTINE -->

    Daily Island Routine
  </h2>

  <div class="tropicanaparagraph10">
    <p> Playing on Animal Crossing: New Horizons provides players with a way of escaping their day to day lives and living a virtual life with no restrictions.
        This is especially useful at the moment given the current conditions of the pandemic.
        <br> <br>
        In order to make the most of the game and to keep your island in good shape, logging in daily is recommended by a lot of players.
        I myself as an Animal Crossing player, login daily to complete my set of daily tasks.
        <br> <br>
        Firstly I login and speak to all my favourite villagers to make sure their friend status is kept high and then I collect my daily login bonus from the resident services.
        If I have any spare time I will also pick up and weeds on my island, collect fruit from the trees and sell any resourses found to make some exrta money.</p>

    Island Residents
  </h2>

  <div class="tropicanaparagraph11">
    <p> Animal Crossing islands can have a total of ten villagers at one time and of course the player who owns the island.
        Tropicana has all ten villager slots occupied. The island only started off having the two started villagers, but slowly I purchased more villagers off the nookazon website.
        <br> <br>
        Below are some of my favourite villagers and their character profiles.
