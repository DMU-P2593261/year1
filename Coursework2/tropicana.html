        Once the tutorial for the game has ended the airport opens up fully and allows players to travel back and forth to islands owned by other players.
        That is assuming they have a Nintendo Online subscription.

<!-- DAILY ROUTINE -->

    Daily Island Routine
  </h2>

  <div class="tropicanaparagraph10">
    <p>
      Playing on Animal Crossing: New Horizons provides players with a way of escaping their day to day lives and living a virtual life with no restrictions.
      This is especially useful at the moment given the current conditions of the pandemic.
      <br> <br>
      In order to make the most of the game and to keep your island in good shape, logging in daily is recommended by a lot of players.
      I myself as an Animal Crossing player, login daily to complete my set of daily tasks.
      <br> <br>
      Firstly I login and speak to all my favourite villagers to make sure their friend status is kept high and then I collect my daily login bonus from the resident services.
      If I have any spare time I will also pick up and weeds on my island, collect fruit from the trees and sell any resourses found to make some exrta money.
    </p>

  <h2 id="islandresidents">
    Island Residents
  </h2>

  <div class="tropicanaparagraph11">
    <p>
      Animal Crossing islands can have a total of ten villagers at one time and of course the player who owns the island.
      Tropicana has all ten villager slots occupied. The island only started off having the two started villagers, but slowly I purchased more villagers off the nookazon website.
      <br> <br>
      Below are some of my favourite villagers and their character profiles.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- ISLAND RESIDENT (TANGY) -->
<h3 class="residenttitle">
  Tangy
</h3>

<div class="residentimage">
  <img src="img/tropicanatangy2.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="residentdetails">
    <p> Name:
    <br> Tangy </p>
    <br>
    <p> Personality:
    <br> Peppy </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="residentparagraph">
  <p>
    Tangy is probably my new favourite villager. She has an overreactive hyper personality and always has the right thing to say in any situation.
    With her peppy personality she is always happy to see me and never gives up on a task.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND RESIDENT (BUNNIE) -->
<h3 class="residenttitle">
  Bunnie
</h3>

<div class="residentimage">
  <img src="img/tropicanabunnie.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="residentdetails">
    <p> Name:
    <br> Bunnie </p>
    <br>
    <p> Personality:
    <br> Peppy </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="residentparagraph">
  <p>
    Bunnie was my favourite villager from playing Animal Crossing: Wild World back in 2009.
    Whenever I played Wild World I used to always chat with Bunnie at least three times a day and give her as many gifts as possible.
    So of course when I realised that Bunnie was still in New Horizons I had to make sure she was part of my island
    as there were so many memories behind that character.

  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND RESIDENT (LOLLY) -->
<h3 class="residenttitle">
  Lolly
</h3>

<div class="residentimage">
  <img src="img/tropicanalolly.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="residentdetails">
    <p> Name:
    <br> Lolly </p>
    <br>
    <p> Personality:
    <br> Normal </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="residentparagraph">
  <p>
    Lolly is a villager I found while browsing the Amazon styled market place Nookazon.
    She is a considerably popular villager so getting hold of her was not easy but I managed to secure a deal for a couple of million bells.
    Overall I really like having lolly on my island as she has the normal personality therefore she does not have any specific personality traits.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND RESIDENT (BOB) -->
<h3 class="residenttitle">
  Bob
</h3>

<div class="residentimage">
  <img src="img/tropicanabob.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="residentdetails">
    <p> Name:
    <br> Bob </p>
    <br>
    <p> Personality:
    <br> Lazy </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="residentparagraph">
  <p>
    Bob is actually my latest addition to the island as of writing this page. Bob's personality is Lazy which makes him rather easy to spend time around.
    As an A class cat villager, Bob is one of the most fun and loving viallgers that a lot of players try to get on their islands. Thankfully I found a great deal on the market place.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND RESIDENT (ANKHA) -->
<h3 class="residenttitle">
  Ankha
</h3>

<div class="residentimage">
  <img src="img/tropicanaankha.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="residentdetails">
    <p> Name:
    <br> Ankha </p>
    <br>
    <p> Personality:
    <br> Snooty </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="residentparagraph">
  <p>
    Ankha is one of the favourite villagers of all time within New Horizons.
    She is an extremely popular S class villager and players will sometimes spend up to twelve million bells to get her on their island.
    Like the other rare villagers I have purchased I managed to get Ankha for a mere two million bells, which I am most happy about.
    At first I was unsure about her snooty personality but as time has gone on I have got more attached to her as a villager.
  </p>
</div>


<!-- NATIVE FRUIT -->
<h2 id="nativefruit">
  Native Island Fruit
</h2>

<div class="tropicanaparagraph10">
  <p>
    Every island on Animal Crossing has some sort of fruit growing on the trees.
    On Tropicana the main fruit which the island started with is oranges.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="nativefruitimage">
  <img src="img/orangetree.jpg" alt="an image showing tangy the villager sitting next to an orange tree">
</div>

<div class="tropicanaparagraph11">
  <p>
    However, there are multiple types of fruit in the game. Players can start their islands
    with either cherries, peaches, apples, pears and of course oranges.
    In order to get the other fruits on my island I traded with other players on Nookazon.
    After collecting ten of each fruit I created an orchard.
    This was a profitable decision as Tropicana native fruit sell for 100 bells each whereas other fruit sell for 500 bells each.
  </p>

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC -->
<div id="islandmusic">
  <h2> Island Music </h2>
</div>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    Within New Horizons there are 95 songs available for players to collect for their music players.
    Players can use these songs on any item that can play music such as a stero, jukebox or radio.
    As of writing this, Tropicana has just over 65 out of the 95 songs.
    <br> <br>
    Below are five of my personal favourite pieces of music from within New Horizons.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC (Drivin) -->
<h3 class="musictitle">
  K.K. Drivin'
</h3>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    K.K. Drivin is one of my favourite soundtracks from the game. The unique instrumentals and overall up-beat feel makes it a good addition to any island.
    The version below is a re-created version of the original but the melody and overall tune is the same.
    The drop for this song gets me every time, the instruments work so well together and it has a real punch to it.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC (Country) -->
<h3 class="musictitle">
  K.K. Country
</h3>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    K.K. Country is one of the most catchy of the KK songs.
    It closely resembles music used in Mario Kart from the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo DS version.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC (Salsa) -->
<h3 class="musictitle">
  K.K. Salsa
</h3>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    K.K. Salsa is a song based off of the dance. The music gives off a vibe that would be played during a salsa.
    It generally gives off happy vibes. No wonder so many villagers choose to play this song in their homes.
  </p>
</div>

<audio controls class="islandmusicaudio">

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC (Bubblegum) -->
<h3 class="musictitle">
  K.K. Bubblegum
</h3>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    K.K. Bubblegum is one of the most popular songs from New Horizons.
    A lot of players obsess over this song and it has had many remakes by several artists.
    The song provides a bubbly vibe and generally makes listeners feel more happy.
  </p>
</div>

<audio controls class="islandmusicaudio">
  <source src="aud/kkbubblegum.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/>

<!-- ISLAND MUSIC (Disco) -->
<h3 class="musictitle">
  K.K. Disco
</h3>

<div class="islandmusicparagraph">
  <p>
    K.K. Disco is definitely up there with my favourite songs from New Horizons.
    The song gives off a sort of technopop energy, as if it was being created live by a DJ.
    Overall this song is definitely worth adding to any islands music collection.
