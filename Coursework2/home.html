  <p> This website has been specifically created to provide information about Nintendo's game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
  <br> Using the navigation system you may explore a variety of pages containing information on various subjects relating to the game.

<!-- The video element was created to have two file formats instead of just one to maximise the compatability of the video Playing
  within as many browsers as possible. A poster has also been added to further add a more professional looking design and feel to the page.
  A video fallback was written in underneath the sources to provide an additional option for browsers if they happen to not support both formats given.

  Within the footer, the websites terms and conditions as well as the privacy policy can be directly accessed through two anchored text links.
  The footer also contains basic information such as copyright info. This is of course not actual copyright info but as a design choice it creates the
  realistic approach which was being aimed for.-->
