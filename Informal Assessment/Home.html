<h1 style="text-align:center">What Is Minecraft?</h1>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - WHAT IS MINECRAFT -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Minecraft is an open world sandbox game that allows users to create and explore as little or as
<br> much as they want. Minecraft currently sits at the number one spot being the most played and
<br> downloaded game of all time. With over 200 million copies sold worldwide and 126 million
<br> monthly players it certainly is not a game that will not be easily forgotten. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Creative Mode</h3>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - CREATIVE MODE -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Creative mode is a gamemode within Minecraft that allows players to use an unlimited
<br> amount of resources and build whatever they want whenever they want without any limitations
<br> of health or having to survive in the open. Most people consider creative to be a waste
<br> of time as it is "not the point of the game". However, some people have used creative mode
<br> to build some extraordinary things. For example, someone has successfully made a discord
<br> community of over 50,000 people and rebuilt (scaled to 1:1 block scale)
<br> the entirety of the world in a flat open world environment.

<!-- WEBSITE SUB-HEADING - SURVIVAL MODE -->
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Survival Mode</h3>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - SURVIVAL MODE -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Survival mode is the complete opposite to creative mode as when you spawn in to the randomly
<br> generated environment you have no resources, just your bare hands and the world around you.
<br> The main objective of survival mode is essentially to survive for as long as possible while
<br> completing achievements and exploring different areas of the game to discover new materials
<br> and resources. In survival mode the end of the game is often associated with the end dimension
<br> which is where the ender dragon lives. This is the end-game boss which only the most powerful
<br> and skilled players can defeat. Once players have killed the dragon a reward in the
<br> form of a dragon egg is obtained, and a portal is opened for them to travel back home safely.

<!-- WEBSITE SUB-HEADING - SURVIVAL MODE -->
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Adventure Mode</h3>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - SURVIVAL MODE -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Adventure mode is a unique mode primarily used by map makers. Some players like to
<br> create mini-games and maps that can be uploaded and downloaded online. These maps could be
<br> anything from an extremely difficult multiplayer labyrinth or a nerve wrecking horror map.
<br> Either way all these games have one thing in common. And that is adventure mode.
<br> The reason this mode is specifically chosen for these games and maps is due to its
<br> unique restrictions. Unlike creative and survival, you cannot break or place blocks in
<br> adventure mode. You are purely limited to walking around and interacting with the environment.
<br> No editing to terrain or buildings can be made, therefore making it easier for mapmakers
<br> to direct players through a certain path or prevent accidental breakages of redstone or command
<br> blocks controlling the map they spent hours creating.

  <li>The End</li>
</ul>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - DIMENSIONS -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Within Minecraft there are three different dimensions that you can play in. There is the
<br> overworld which is the default area in which you spawn in, the Nether which is a hell like place
<br> with a very dangerous environment and The End which is a desolate landscape with not much
<br> to say for itself. Players must use portals to travel between these dimensions.

<!-- WEBSITE SUB-HEADING - THE OVERWORLD -->
<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Overworld</h3>


<!-- WEBSITE PARAGRAPH - THE OVERWORLD -->
<p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> The overworld is the first dimension that you will spawn in when you very first create a world
<br> in Minecraft. Within the overworld there are over 60 different biomes which contain a wide
<br> variety of plant and animal life. The overworld is essentially your home world and is where you
<br> will spend most of your time while playing and exploring. The overworld is
<br> around 60 million by 60 million blocks in size and this is to a 1:1 metre scale. This means
<br> that the Minecraft world is theoretically seven times larger than the surface of the Earth.
<br> Once the player reaches the edge of the map a place known as the farlands come in to view.
<br> This is where the game code cannot render any more infinite landscape and the environment
<br> and gameplay to break down and corrupt. The landscape here looks rather distorted compared
<br> to everywhere else as the game cannot process the amount of numbers and code.
